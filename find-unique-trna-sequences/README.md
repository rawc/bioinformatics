# Finding Unique TRNA Sequences
This program reads in a FASTA file of TRNA sequences and finds all of the unique sequences to the specific gene. 
The output will show the specific TRNA sequences that have not been found in any other sequence, allowing researchers to correctly identify TRNA sequnces
