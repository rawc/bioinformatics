# Finding Open Reading Frames
An open reading frame (ORF) is a region of DNA that is free from stop codons (TAG, TAA, TGA). We can then define a putative gene in that ORF by the presence of a start codon at the 5' end of the ORF and a stop codon at the 3' end. Start codons in some bacteria, archaea and viruses can be ATG, GTG or CTG, and in some cases TTG.  

Since genes are made up of codons of three symbols, any particular sequence of DNA can be interpreted in each of 3 overlapping coding frames, and since DNA is double stranded, we can have genes located on both strands, yielding 6 possible coding frames for the many genes in a genome.  Genes can also overlap each other.
