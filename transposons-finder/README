Jumping genes, or Transposons, can be found all throughout many biological domains. They are DNA segments that are constantly moving around a genome. These types of DNA segments have a wide range of use in the genome, from creating new mutations, to devel- oping anti-biotic resistance in bacteria, to even DNA fin- gerprinting in genetic testing. Finding transposons man- ually can be daunting. It is difficult to search a sequence of DNA that may be thousands of lines long to find all IR(inverted repeats) or DR(direct repeats). This program is a new method of finding all IRs and DRs in a genetic sequence from a FASTA file
